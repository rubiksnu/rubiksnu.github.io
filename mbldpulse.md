# My pulse during Rubik's Cube: Multiple Blindfolded. 
I have used the pulse meter in my [Microsoft Band](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-band) during my Rubik's Cube: Multiple blindfolded practice. 

I messed everything up in the [Euro 2016 Rubik's Cube: Multiple Blindfolded](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/Euro2016/results/all#e333mbf_c) and got a DNF (3/8). I was a bit nervous and memorized things wrong, corrected it and got stresses up and in the end I even popped one of the cubes. I was wearing my Microsoft Band at the Euro so I got a nice graph of my pulse during the attempt and thought it would be funny to show it to others. I also showing some graphs from my practice. Some of them are not "full" attempts (not doing maximum numbers of cube I can do in an hour). 
This is "just for fun" and the measuring method of my pulse has questionable accuracy but I think the it is possible to read something valuable for some people from this.

### 4/6 
This one I was rather shore I would do my first 6/6 when I was solving witch I think mirrors the pulse. During memorization I remembered the cubes rather easy and the solving started nice "col" and I was not stressed at all. On the last cubes as started to think of doing my best results at the time. I had two flipped edges on two of the cubes.

### This last one is from my DNF at [Euro 2016](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/Euro2016/).
